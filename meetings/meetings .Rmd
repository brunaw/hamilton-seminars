# Meetings

## 1st meeting: June 4, 2019

## Summary

- The seminars will start at the end of September (start of term 2)
- A priori, we will have one seminar every week
- Abstracts should be asked to the speakers one week in advance, for us to advertise it and maybe make a small booklet after
- The schedule needs to be discussed over Slack:
  - The order can be voluntary
  - If no one volunteers to present at some date, we'll randomly assign a name
- Damien will check if there's any funding possibility for the seminars (for food, for example)
- In general, the pesenter's supervisor will not be invited, unless the presenter decides otherwise, for her or his own reasons 


## Action points

- Organise the mailing list - Hazel
- Set up (or check how to setup up) the webpage - Tristan
- Make a poll to decide the best day and time for the seminars - Bruna 
- After the day/time is decided, book the seminar room with Kate - Bruna 


## 2nd meeting: June 27, 2019
